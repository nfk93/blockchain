Handle edge cases:
    Received block with unknown transactions
    Handle transaction duplicatioon when switching head

Add checks and balances
Add initialization method (use channels)

Add delay for switching head to branch of equal length, as discussed in advisory meeting
(maybe) Make newly discovered transactions in block be broadcasted via p2p layer
