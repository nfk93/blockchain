# Proof-of-Stake Blockchain

This is a CLI implementing a synchronous of a Proof-of-Stake blockchain protocol.

### Installing

1. Download and setup GO from http://golang.org/
2. Setup your GOPATH environment variable
3. Run "go get https://github.com/nfk93/blockchain"
4. Run "go build" in the root folder of the project, this produces blockchain.exe

Alternatively, simply clone the the project to %GOPATH%/src/github.com/nfk93/blockchain and build it there

### Running

Running "blockchain.exe -help" will display the following:

```
Usage of blockchain.exe:
  -a string
        Address to connect to, INCLUDING PORT, (if not set, start own network)
  -epoch_length uint
        Specify the epoch length, only set this is if you're starting a new network (default 100)
  -finalize_gap uint
        Specify the finalization gap, only set this is if you're starting a new network (default 1500)
  -hardness float
        Specify hardness (default 0.1)
  -log
        Set to write log of tree in each slot to /out (default false)
  -p string
        Port to be listening on used for p2p (default "65000")
  -run_locally
        Set if only running locally (default true) (default true)
  -slot_duration int
        Specify the slot length in seconds (default 10)
```

To start a new blockchain run
```
blockchain.exe -p=65000 -slot_duration=5 -epoch_length=20 -finalize_gap=100 -hardness=0.5
```
replacing the above example values with your desire

Before starting the blockchain protocol, you will want to connect all other participants by running 
```
blockchain.exe -a=<some_address> -p=65001
```
where <some_address> must be the address of someone already on the network, including his port 
(for example, if the above case was run, a good choice would be "127.0.0.1:65000", since it runs locally unless setting the flag -run_locally=false)

When everyone is connected, the one who started the network can type start into his CLI, at which point everyone on the network should report "Genesis received! Starting blockchain protocol"

### Running a test example

To run a test example, you can use the bat file startPeersForDebug.bat, which starts a network with the parameters used in the example above and connects 5 peers to it. When the peers are connected (takes roughly 15 seconds), use "start" in the commandline window titled "Network Owner". Each peer should now look like this:
```
my ip is: 127.0.0.1
CONNECTING TO EXISTING NETWORK AT  127.0.0.1:65000
This client is ready for the Blockchain protocol to start. Use -h or --help for further commands!
2019/06/20 11:04:35 Genesis received! Starting blockchain protocol
Â»
```
To test that the blockchain is indeed working, enable verbose on some of the peers by typing 'verbose' in the commandline. Use the two debug methods "debug-autotrans" and "debug-trans5" to make some test transactions. The full list of commands can be found by typing -h or --help, which lists 
```
  Command:                            Description:
